# GreyhoundPackageIndex

These are Package Index lists that are used with [Greyhound](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound), including Bo2, Bo3, and Bo4, this is a continuation of DTZxPorter's [CommunityNameDB](https://github.com/dtzxporter/CommunityNameDB).

For Bo4 Index Files, Click [Here](https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex/tree/master/PackageIndexSources/BO4).

For the latest compiled package index files, check the [Releases](https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex/releases) section. These are shipped with the following version of Greyhound after they are pushed.

For the PackageIndexTool to convert package files, Click [Here](https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex/raw/master/PackageIndexTool/PackageIndexTool.exe), which will allow you to convert the index files to WNI, and decompile the WNI files to CSVs. Once compiled, copy the WNI file into the `package_index` folder and reload.

Please see [Specification](https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex/blob/master/PackageIndexSpecBo4.md) before submitting your names, they will need to conform to it first. Don't bother using the GIT client, just file an [Issue](https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex/issues) and someone will add them for you!
